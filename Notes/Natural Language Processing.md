# Natural Language Processing

## Output
we can use a function to display text and symbols on the screen
We use the`print()` function to display output

```python
print("Your text goes in here.")
```

## [[Headers]]

# Comments
Comments are pieces of text that are not interpreted by Python
This means that the text is **ignored**
We use the # symbol to make comments

```python
# This is a comment
```
