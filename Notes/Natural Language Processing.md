# Natural Language Processing

## Output
we can use a function to display text and symbols on the screen
We use the`print()` function to display output

```python
print("Your text goes in here.")
```

## [[Headers]]

# Comments
Comments are pieces of text that are not interpreted by Python
This means that the text is **ignored**
We use the # symbol to make comments

```python
# This is a comment
```

# Input
We can grab information from the user using `input()
When we run the function, it does two things:
1. it waits for the user to write something or nothing
2. the user presses **Enter/Return** to indicate that they're finished

```python
input()

input(<prompt>)     # prints out the prompt then waits
```

## Variables
Variables allow us to store information for the time that our app is running.

```python
favorite_food = input("whats your favorite food? ")
```

favorite_food -> name of the variable
= -> assignment operator
input... -> value

### Naming
what can you do:
1. naming them with letters, numbers, underscored
2. names **should** start with a lowercase
What you cant do:
1. you **can't** name them with spaces or symbols
2. you **can't** name them with certain names that are reserved
	1. e.g `if, while, for, and, or`

A good name is something like this:
```python
favorite_food
fave_food
date_of birth
student_number
```

Bad names are like this:
```python
Favorute_food
a
num
aa
aaa
aaaa
hello
```
